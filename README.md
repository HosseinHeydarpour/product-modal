# ProductModal 🚀

This is a mini project built using **Angular** and **Tailwind CSS**. I integrated [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to practice using Angular's `HttpClient`, and added a few fallback states. It’s not perfect — the main focus was on **learning and mastering Tailwind CSS**, not Angular. The design follows a **mobile-first approach** 📱.

**Live Demo**: [https://product-modal-six.vercel.app/](https://product-modal-six.vercel.app/) 🔗
